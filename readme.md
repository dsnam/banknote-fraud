The dataset used here is the [Banknote
Authentication dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication)

Initial results with Naive Bayes were poor so I used KDE and achieved good results.

Logreg also achives very high accuracy.

See jupyter notebook for visualizations. There are pairwise scatters and some 3d plots. Final
plot is of particular interest as it should explain high accuracies.

update: added svm in R
